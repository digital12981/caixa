# Real Estate Auction Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for browsing real estate auction properties, specifically designed for Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal's property auctions in Brazil. The platform allows users to browse properties by state, view detailed property information, and explore auction opportunities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with REST API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (currently using in-memory storage for development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Built on Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS with custom Caixa branding colors (blue and orange)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration across the stack
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive components

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for property management
- **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema definitions
- **Storage**: Currently using in-memory storage (MemStorage) with plans for PostgreSQL integration
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for logging and error handling

### Database Schema
The application defines two main entities:
- **Users**: Basic user management with username/password authentication
- **Properties**: Comprehensive property data including location, pricing, auction details, and images

### UI Components
The application uses a comprehensive set of UI components from shadcn/ui including:
- Form controls (inputs, selects, buttons)
- Layout components (cards, dialogs, sheets)
- Data display (tables, pagination, tooltips)
- Navigation (breadcrumbs, menus)

## Data Flow

1. **Property Browsing**: Users start at the home page and navigate to state selection
2. **State Filtering**: Users select a Brazilian state to filter properties
3. **Property Listing**: System fetches and displays properties for the selected state
4. **Property Details**: Users can view detailed information about individual properties
5. **API Integration**: All data flows through REST endpoints with proper error handling

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority, clsx
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date utilities

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Development Tools**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin and Replit integrations
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configuration through Vite
- **Development Server**: Hot module replacement with Vite

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

### Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Uses tsx to run the TypeScript server directly
- **Client Build**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: In-memory storage for rapid development

### Production Build
- **Server**: esbuild bundles the server code for Node.js
- **Client**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built client assets

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Configured via environment variables
- **Build Output**: Separate directories for server and client builds
- **Asset Handling**: Vite handles asset optimization and bundling
